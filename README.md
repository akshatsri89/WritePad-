## The goal of this project is to implement a text editor that can handle text files.
### The software is written in Python language version 3.8.2

## The features of WritePad :-
* It will be able to read and display a text file. Long lines are not wrapped but
simply clipped at the right margin.
* The user will be able to type and delete characters in the text
* There will be a caret and a selection. Words should also be selectable with a
double click.
* The user will be able to scroll.
* There will be menu commands for opening and saving text files. If a new text
file is opened via a menu command it should be displayed in a new viewer.
* There will be menu commands for Cut, Copy and Paste operations. This requires
an application-wide clipboard to be implemented.
